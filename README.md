# Udemy-Courses-Data-Analysis

## Installation:

-Python 3.6 
-The libraries used to produce the results are :- numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn. 

## Project Motivation:

-I wanted to get a better understanding of the trends in the type of online courses that people are more likely to subscribe to. The dataset used for this is taken from kaggle which has course details from Udemy.
-Using the dataset, I tried to answer the following questions:

1. What subject do the most subscribed courses belong to?
2. Which level of the courses gets more subscribers?
3. Does the number of subscribers depend upon the duration of course?


## File Descriptions:

There is one single jupyter notebook that processes the csv file and answers each of the questions mentioned in the Project Motivation section. I have used the markdown cells to guide through the thought process.

## Results:
